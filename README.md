# Moleculer-DB-GraphQL

Moleculer-db comes with a very elegant interface which allows a service to go from zero to 100 in terms of CRUD and other supporting operations. It also provides a REST api to go along with it. 

What it doesn't have it a GraphQL schema for those who are using moleculer-apollo-server. 

This mixin bridges that gap. 

# Installation

Use the following commadn 
```
npm i --save @thesatoshicompany/moleculer-db-graphql
```
